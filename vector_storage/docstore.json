prepared this report in 2020 with updated findings and follow-up recommendations regarding the promotion of EVs and the recent adoption of smart mobility in Hong Kong.\n\nIn the 2014 study, it revealed the need for the Government to play a pivotal role in EV adoption, infrastructure, talent, and the general safety of the recycling of EVs and EV batteries in Hong Kong. This study reviews the implementation progress of the said recommendations in Hong Kong. Despite this, the current study conducted researches on a number of technologies that have emerged in recent years, including high-power charging, connected vehicles and autonomous driving technologies. Taking edge-cutting technologies into account, this study also makes views and recommendations to both green transportation and the emerging smart mobility sector in Hong Kong.\n\n### Chapter 1\n\nChapter 1 enlists the study\u2019s purpose, background, and methodology.\n\n### Chapter 2\n\nChapter 2 briefly reviews the top five foreign regions in terms of their EV adoption rate, the status of EV adoption in Hong Kong, together with four recommendations for Hong Kong to facilitate a wider adoption of commercial EVs.\n\n### Chapter 3\n\nRecommendations for improving the EV charging infrastructure in Hong Kong have been made in Chapter 3.\n\n### Chapter 4\n\nThe focus is on a series of emerging technologies, which are listed and discussed thoroughly in Chapter 4, with recommendations on how to support these new emerging technologies.\n\n### Chapter 5\n\nWe explore concerns about talent problems relating to repair and maintenance services offered by independent garages in Chapter 5.\n\n### Chapter 6\n\nIssues about the decommissioning of batteries and EVs have been covered in Chapter 6.\n\n### Chapter 7\n\nChapter 7 serves as a conclusion.\n\nMajor recommendations of this study for all the stakeholders in Hong Kong EV industry are summarized as follows:\n\n- Government policy in terms of facilitating commercial EV adoption\n\nIt is commonly known that commercial vehicles are one of the major sources of roadside emissions in Hong Kong. Improvement should be made further if these commercial vehicles are powered by electricity instead of internal combustion engines.\n\nRecommendation 1: Offer incentives and special programs for commercial fleets\n\nTo begin with, it is recommended that the policymakers consider expanding EV usage among commercial fleets.", "start_char_idx": 1730, "end_char_idx": 4291, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1964a8aa-bcbe-4d23-bcaf-cb310b8bfc51": {"__data__": {"id_": "1964a8aa-bcbe-4d23-bcaf-cb310b8bfc51", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ef133e0-c32e-458b-8aae-8d7fbed2579b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "a590dcd150456a2e5d623f2a51a7ecf856f826153eff6330580accc0de435860", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "97b8f4d7-9700-4868-b757-7ed110f7fad2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "f4db06cf99e97da8676023f6e9e97a6a54a5e7efc3c0a7b47792796b31b5af6f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4e740d41-6f33-4a1c-a75e-8166fd8056dc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8d932ef356433c8c48220caa5544856d6ab5d150f38461c419fb581229a8c3f9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "For example, franchised buses are suitable targets for electric vehicle or hybrid electric vehicle adoption schemes. Commercial fleets may also be encouraged to adopt new technologies such as battery swapping, wireless charging, and supercapacitors.\n---\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nRecommendation 2: Provide high power charging facilities\n\nBoth the policy makers and Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) operators are recommended to provide high power charging facilities with a minimum of 200kW which can charge an EV within 30 minutes.\n\nRecommendation 3: Develop commercial EVs meet the needs of Hong Kong\n\nIt is recommended that local R&D centres collaborate with Mainland China or overseas vehicle manufacturers to develop tailor-made medium-duty EVs and heavy-duty EVs that are specifically designed for the operational needs and traffic conditions present in Hong Kong. To promote EV adoption, it is also recommended that the policy makers should consider to set up more specialised and target oriented programmes like trial schemes to facilitate EV adoption progress in Hong Kong.\n\nRecommendation 4: Provide infrastructure support for private EVs\n\nThe policy makers should promote and strengthen the deployment of EVSE with a more strategic vision for EV infrastructure support. Similar to other regions, this can be achieved through incentive programmes, tax concessions and pilot programmes.\n\n## The setup of EV charging infrastructure\n\nRecommendation 5: Create connections between stakeholders\n\nIn order to establish a more sophisticated EV charging network in Hong Kong, the local market could form an industrial platform to build common targets, goals and strategies for the development of EV charging infrastructure. The industrial platform can also connect key stakeholders including the government, the power companies, charging service providers, property management offices, universities, R&D institutes and EV user groups.\n\nRecommendation 6: Encourage private sector\u2019s participation and promote paid charging services\n\nIt is no doubt that encouraging the private sector to enter the market is a more sustainable solution to cater market demand as well as easing the government \u2019s burden on providing EV charging service, therefore, the policy makers should encourage the private sector in developing paid charging facilities.\n\nRecommendation 7: Support the development of innovative charging technologies\n\nThe policy makers could select dedicated demonstration sites to centralise the demonstration and trial of EV charging technologies. Through these sites, it can facilitate more experience sharing and knowledge exchange among the academic, research and industry sectors, which will naturally foster the technology development.", "start_char_idx": 4292, "end_char_idx": 7038, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e740d41-6f33-4a1c-a75e-8166fd8056dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e740d41-6f33-4a1c-a75e-8166fd8056dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ef133e0-c32e-458b-8aae-8d7fbed2579b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "a590dcd150456a2e5d623f2a51a7ecf856f826153eff6330580accc0de435860", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1964a8aa-bcbe-4d23-bcaf-cb310b8bfc51", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "1ca600d2f774652cb7154908d2f9775ad899916191fdf95dac5e1f26b0a5ffd2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "215f2562-659b-4282-8480-595321b842ac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e90b16640f5f63a1b641cc40fa5a150b9fa40b5672aae8a1ba650283a5fddbf2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "## Emerging EV technologies\n\nRecommendation 8: Support for and testing of emerging EV technologies\n\nRegarding the development of emerging EV technologies in Hong Kong, the policy makers could provide financial incentives and testing facilities for the power companies, charging service providers, telecommunications service providers, open data providers, property management offices, universities, R&D institutes, EV user groups and other interested parties as they work together to build common targets, goals, strategies and road maps. The policy makers should also review current regulations, identify obsolete or outdated regulations, and set up new regulations and a legislative framework that are applicable to new EV technologies.\n\nOn the other hand, if the policy makers provide funding support for the test bed of advanced and emerging EV technologies in Hong Kong, it may hasten the pace of commercialisation and attract investment from the private sector.\n\nAlso, the policy makers could deploy a 5G network and set up a common platform for data sharing among developers, manufacturers and stakeholders to support the development of V2X technologies and autonomous driving.\n---\n## Talent development\n\nThe under-supply of qualified EV mechanics and independent EV service garages in Hong Kong continue to raise concerns over the convenience, cost and safety of EVs in the city, which constitutes a major obstacle for car owners who are contemplating to switch to an EV.\n\n### Recommendation 9: Fulfil the latest Specification of Competency Standards for EV training\n\nIt is recommended that the automotive industry and training institutions should introduce training courses immediately to fulfil the EV competency standards as stated in the latest version of \u201cSpecification of Competency Standards\u201d.

The study was conducted by Automotive Platforms and Application Systems (APAS) R&D Centre, in collaboration with Hong Kong Productivity Council.\n\nThe Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has been promoting the adoption of EVs in both the private and commercial sectors for years. In March 2009, a steering committee led by the Financial Secretary was set up to promote the use of EVs in Hong Kong. In 2010, the HKSAR set up a HK$300 million Pilot Green Transport Fund to support the testing of green and innovative technologies, which are applicable to the public transport sector and goods vehicles.\n\nIn October 2014, APAS and HKPC issued a study named \u201cAn Industry Study on Electric Vehicle Adoption in Hong Kong\u201d, which reviewed the state of EV adoption in selected foreign countries and in Hong Kong.

In this report, we review the implementation status of these recommendations, with the findings presented in chapters corresponding to the recommendations.\n\n1.3 Methodology of this study\n\n1.3.1 Conducting international surveys and collecting local views\n\nPart of the research for this study consisted of market surveys and desktop research regarding EV adoption in major markets around the world. Existing government policies in these foreign markets pertaining to the promotion of EV adoption were also reviewed, to provide a holistic view of good practices that are being implemented, and to help identify specific needs relevant to Hong Kong context that will help us to achieve green transportation by adopting EVs in both the private and commercial sectors.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nInterviews and surveys were also conducted with major local stakeholders to collect their views and concerns on EV adoption. These included government departments and bureaus, educational institutions, commercial fleet operators, trade unions, property developers, and management offices.\n---\n## C H A P T E R 1\n\n1.3.2 Providing information to facilitate a holistic plan by policy makers\n\nThe number of EVs for road use in Hong Kong increased from less than 100 in end 2010 to 13,866 in the end of December 2019. During the stakeholder interviews, we learned that there are vast differences between EVs and internal combustion engine vehicles in many areas \u2013 in terms of the overall business models of manufacturers, service providers and other related organisations; consumer usage behaviour; the charging infrastructure; type approval; and technician training for repairing and maintenance. Therefore, same as the case in other markets around the world, it is very important to create a holistic plan for Hong Kong\u2019s readiness for EV adoption, and to provide support the realisation of this plan.\n\nIn order to understand the need from the industry, APAS has set up an Electric Vehicle Stakeholder Interest Group (EVSIG), which holds regular meetings to collect the views and concerns of stakeholders.", "start_char_idx": 11619, "end_char_idx": 14109, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5651d0f-0218-4d1a-999d-ba59307131a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5651d0f-0218-4d1a-999d-ba59307131a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ef133e0-c32e-458b-8aae-8d7fbed2579b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "a590dcd150456a2e5d623f2a51a7ecf856f826153eff6330580accc0de435860", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a4b08867-a7ad-4f46-8def-e422008cbd1c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "0f3de46c6e800805cf85ffa0f9fc1dddab373f8c74b5fad2774e827d746b865e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "811a5eb7-76a6-45f3-b348-81cd00b8ba46", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "abd36308963ee7cef52206f2d9b40785b84734783623cfc98e8cc404073c2a4c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Through meetings with EVSIG members, APAS discovered that the industry is currently facing a number of issues that could provide significant obstacles to the growth of both the local EV industry and the wider adoption of EVs in Hong Kong, so much that growth could be stifled entirely. These issues are broadly related to the installation costs and locations of EV charging infrastructure, the current charging time for EVs, the short lifespan of most EV batteries, type approval testing and standards to be adopted, the fact that most regulations were originally conceived and designed for internal combustion engine vehicles, and the shortage of qualified EV maintenance personnel.\n\n1.3.3 Identifying five key EV adoption areas\n\nBased on interviews and desktop surveys conducted with local stakeholders, this study identified five key areas in the EV industry infrastructure and ecosystem that need special attention and support in order to reduce barriers to the adoption of EVs.\n\nThese five areas are:\n\n1. Government policies facilitating the adoption of EVs;\n2. The setup of EV charging infrastructure;\n3. Emerging EV technologies;\n4. Talent development for EV maintenance and support;\n5.

However, at the moment, charging facilities are mainly available in government car parks, shopping malls and other public areas only, with a few charging facilities available in private residential buildings. This means that electric private car drivers need to leave their homes to recharge their vehicles.\n\n#### 2.3.2 Better management of public charging facilities needed\n\nA persistent irritant for electric private car drivers is that public parking places with charging facilities are frequently occupied by non-electric vehicles. This is a common situation in public car parks. As the number of charging facilities is already low, the situation is getting worse due to this parking place mismatch. A similar problem is EVs remaining at these public charging points even after the charging process has been completed. Better management of public charging facilities is surely needed.\n\nEnvironmental Protection Department, Installation of EV Chargers, retrieved from https://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/english/environmentinhk/air/prob_solutions/promotion_ev.html\n---\n## Chapter 2\n\n2.3.3 Private garages cannot repair EV drive chains and power systems\n\nThe drive chains and power systems of EVs are totally different from conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. Repair and tuning of these drive chains and power systems require a high level of knowledge of electronics and information technology. Also, EVs have high voltage power chain systems, with serious potential hazards of electric shock and even fire. Common ICE automotive mechanics do not have the correct skill set to repair these vehicles. Moreover, the factory settings and the tuning parameters of most electric vehicles are proprietary knowledge of the EV maker, with most brands unwilling to release these details on the open market. This leads to a situation whereby EVs need to be repaired by only the original manufacturer or their dealers, which can considerably lengthen the service downtime of EVs.\n\n2.4 Challenges in EV adoption in commercial vehicles\n\nCommercial vehicle operators face more challenges to integrating EVs into their fleet as compared to the private car users.", "start_char_idx": 37159, "end_char_idx": 39589, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "34512a04-dea7-4cc3-966e-0c53f448ec56": {"__data__": {"id_": "34512a04-dea7-4cc3-966e-0c53f448ec56", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ef133e0-c32e-458b-8aae-8d7fbed2579b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "a590dcd150456a2e5d623f2a51a7ecf856f826153eff6330580accc0de435860", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6e31dd3f-eba3-4d10-ba97-2dc3cf473a49", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "e0cee1edae95268c5eae3f5c048bcb0b308f063ba29b76bcce5b8604c9043dd6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "064b1e37-0888-4359-881b-3a6830d034c6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0d6ccdfc9fc9e3f992b341a871a83ce6568c2742fcdfe7b4fa8422a80796eacb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "2.4.1 More parking places for charging required\n\nThere are not enough parking places for commercial vehicles in Hong Kong \u2013 commercial vehicles of any kind. According to the report of HKSAR Audit Commission, until 31 Dec 2018, there are 73,051 commercial vehicles in Hong Kong, but only 46,955 designated parking places for them. Most lorries and buses are seen parked in rural areas as temporary car parks. The power supply in these car parks is limited, and there are no incentives for the owners of these car park owners to install charging facilities.\n\n2.4.2 \u201cDead mileage\u201d arising from the charging process\n\nAs with electric private cars, commercial electric vehicles also have to use public charging stations. When they return from these charging stations to their depots, a certain amount of electricity is consumed. This \u201cdead mileage\u201d reduces the effective mileage and operation time of electric commercial vehicles.\n\n2.4.3 Shortening the charging time is essential\n\nCharging time for commercial vehicles is currently too long. Compared to private electric cars, electric commercial vehicles normally require more power, as most of them are heavy-duty vehicles with a correspondingly larger battery capacity. Though there are nearly 1,500 locations where Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) is located around Hong Kong, around 1,300 of them are level one and level two chargers, both of which take more than four hours to fully charge a heavy-duty commercial vehicle. However, the business model of most commercial fleet operators means that they cannot accept a charging time of longer than one hour.\n\n2.4.4 More EV models needed for different applications\n\nCurrently, there are not enough EV models that are appropriate for commercial operations. There are many types of commercial vehicles. Other than vans, vehicle types include crane lorries, refuse collection vehicles, pressure tankers, oil tankers, dump trucks, and many others. While EV manufacturers are focusing on developing passenger-centric EVs, like sedans, mini-buses, and coaches, there are very limited electric special duty vehicle models.

FRT concessions for EVs for the period from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2021 are as follows:\n\n- Electric private cars \u2013 the FRT will be waived up to HKD 97,500; and a new \u201cOne-for-One Replacement\u201d scheme will run from 28 February 2018 to 31 March 2021, allowing private car owners who first register a new electric private car and who then arrange to scrap and de-register their own eligible old private cars \u2013 private cars with an internal combustion engine or electric private cars \u2013 to enjoy a higher FRT concession, up to a maximum of HKD250,000.\n- Electric commercial vehicles \u2013 including goods vehicles, buses, light buses, taxis, and special purpose vehicles \u2013 along with electric motorcycles and electric motor tricycles will have their FRT waived in full.\n\n### 2.5.2 Profits tax deduction for EV expenditure\n\nStarting from 18 June 2010, commercial companies that have purchased eligible environmentally friendly vehicles may deduct the capital expenditure incurred in the purchase under their profits tax. This new tax concession was applicable in the 2010/11 year of assessment and thereafter. This tax concession covers all types of EVs.\n\n### 2.5.3 Pilot Green Transport Fund\n\nAs a whole, the transport sector, including various modes of road and marine transport, is the second-largest source of air pollution in Hong Kong.

In Hong Kong, emissions from diesel-powered commercial vehicles including trucks, buses and public light buses produce large amounts of airborne particles and nitrogen oxides. In crowded urban environments with busy roads, pollutants trapped at street level can increase the ambient temperature and produce significant health implications. Similar to existing initiatives in London and Beijing, the policy makers should consider targeting commercial fleets for expanding EV numbers in the city.\n\nCommercial fleets such as franchised buses are suitable targets for electric vehicle or hybrid electric vehicle adoption schemes. Replacing diesel-powered vehicles with EVs will appreciably reduce airborne particles and nitrogen oxides at street level. Locally, there are only three bus company operators, meaning it would be relatively easy to manage EV adoption using a phase-in plan when renewing contracts.\n\nSimilarly, taxis, public minibuses and other types of commercial vehicle fleets can also develop phase-in plans to guide fleet replacement, allowing any new replacements to be electric vehicles. EVs are a new class of vehicle, and many new technologies are being developed related to EVs. Commercial fleet operators can also be encouraged to adopt such new technologies as battery swapping, wireless charging and super capacitors. These technologies could be trialled with Government support when they become mature enough for the public trial phase.\n\n## Recommendation 2: Provide high power charging facilities\n\nSimilar to franchised buses and public light buses, the operational time of commercial vehicles is normally in excess of 12 hours per day. Schedules must be strictly adhered to, in order to fulfil the needs and expectations of passengers. Taxi operators have similar operational requirements. Being in operation for so long leaves very limited time for charging, and operators and drivers cannot afford a medium charging time of three hours. Thus, high power charging facilities with minimum of 200kW should be provided which can charge electric commercial vehicle batteries within 30 minutes.\n\n## Recommendation 3: Develop commercial EVs meet the needs of Hong Kong\n\nAs at end of December 2019, there are 13,866 EVs for road use, up from less than 100 in end 2010.", "start_char_idx": 52327, "end_char_idx": 54950, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b44c151-9c03-4e66-8d2b-63be0b55ce33": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b44c151-9c03-4e66-8d2b-63be0b55ce33", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ef133e0-c32e-458b-8aae-8d7fbed2579b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "a590dcd150456a2e5d623f2a51a7ecf856f826153eff6330580accc0de435860", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "428e32b5-c4b4-4d8b-afc5-873cdb1d4685", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "8d62a95dc291fb6ebec8118ea41630e927309ccd1e4648e33b3f1510c30d6f46", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "49940b93-76b5-445f-ab84-d6089d7c2b6d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8457e4072a4bc7f6abb2df234629e3f74ebfb06c45107bbed37f8104a3d5c1da", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "At present, 105 EV models from 10 economies have been type-approved by the Transport Department. These include 76 models for private cars and motorcycles, 29 models for public transport and commercial vehicles. There was only one medium-duty vehicle model and there were no approved models of heavy-duty vehicles or special purpose vehicles like crane lorries, tankers, dump trucks, tractors, refuse collection vehicles and others. As of November 2019, the total registered number of these three vehicle types \u2013 medium-duty, heavy-duty and special purpose \u2013 was more than 45,000. Local R&D centres could collaborate with Mainland China or overseas vehicle manufacturers to develop tailor-made medium-duty vehicles and heavy-duty vehicles which meet the operational needs and traffic conditions of Hong Kong.\n\n## Strengthen and target government incentives for private EV adoption\n\nGovernments often play an active role in promoting and encouraging private EV adoption. This fact is evident from observations made in several other countries.\n\n## Recommendation 4: Provide infrastructure support for private EVs\n\nThe policy makers should consider strengthening their promotion and augmentation of the deployment of EVSE. This can be achieved through incentive programmes, tax concessions and pilot programmes, similar to other markets. Hong Kong needs a strategic vision in terms of EV infrastructure support.\n\nWhile the number of privately owned EVs is steadily rising, the promotion of private EVs is mostly \u2013 and rightfully \u2013 performed by car vendors in a similar manner to the promotion of gasoline powered cars. As in the case in other markets, the policy makers can provide support and facilitate the setup of EV-related infrastructure and charging points for private EVs.

In 2014, we proposed six recommendations for EV charging development strategies. Some of these recommendations have been adopted by the industry while the others are still in the early stages of development. In this section, we will review the implementation progress of each recommendation.\n\n|Our recommendation in 2014|Create a common set of standards for all levels of EV chargers in Hong Kong|\n|---|---|\n|Latest update|Create a common standard for medium chargers and keep the multi-standard for quick chargers|\n\n\"To promote the wider adoption of private EVs, it is recommended that the HKSAR government consider defining the charging standards for all levels of EV chargers and making these charging standards a part of the type approval processes.\"\n\nWe have observed that the majority of medium chargers that have been installed in recent years are of IEC Type 2 standard, which are used by European EVs. These chargers do not pose any obstacles to US and Japanese EVs, as these vehicles can use a simple conversion cable (SAE J1772 to IEC Type 2) when charging, thanks to a compatible communication protocol between those two standards. Although early Tesla EVs employ a proprietary charging standard, all Tesla EVs sold in Hong Kong in recent years are equipped with IEC Type 2 sockets.\n\nHowever, an internationally harmonised standard for quick charging has yet to be developed.", "start_char_idx": 57000, "end_char_idx": 59087, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d9ca6794-7b18-4f5e-a3cd-b0bb74316e01": {"__data__": {"id_": "d9ca6794-7b18-4f5e-a3cd-b0bb74316e01", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ef133e0-c32e-458b-8aae-8d7fbed2579b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "a590dcd150456a2e5d623f2a51a7ecf856f826153eff6330580accc0de435860", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "49940b93-76b5-445f-ab84-d6089d7c2b6d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "cb3e1fc101f1b5f96c531a0c855dec6baba8f70d55fd89a36916fba4ac413416", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bfa1e174-b8f4-45d9-b0d5-c3ddb1af233f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "20ac9f62f318bd456e90126006e96793ae8f1bb456e84074e2653602b09aa37a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "However, an internationally harmonised standard for quick charging has yet to be developed.

Load management technology can analyse and regulate the power usage of each EV charger in real time so that EVs can efficiently share the available electric power supply in a given charging station. Load management technology offers a smart, economical and viable solution to install more EV chargers in an area with limited power supply.\n\nIn Hong Kong, a few charging service providers, charger manufacturers and research institutes have started to provide load management solutions. Although the technology is still in the pilot or small-scale implementation phase, it is foreseen that load management technology will soon become important as the demand for EV chargers grows.\n\n### Our recommendation in 2014\n\nInstall more EV chargers in private residential buildings and commercial sites with government support\n\n\u201cThe HKSAR Government is recommended to consider augmenting its support for setting up EV chargers in residential buildings and power supply infrastructure at commercial sites. This support may be achieved through the extension of the Green Transport Fund to cover the setup costs of EV chargers.\u201d\n\n### Latest update\n\nGreater acceptance due to collaboration between the Government and the private sector\n---\n## C H A P T E R 3\n\nThe HKSAR Government continues to encourage developers and property management companies to facilitate the setup of chargers at existing private residential buildings and install more chargers in commercial premises. Beginning in 2011, gross floor area concessions have been granted for car parks in new buildings; these concessions have been extended in phases, so as to encourage developers to put in place the necessary EV charging infrastructure \u2013 including providing sufficient power supply, cables and ducts \u2013 in the buildings concerned.

For instance, Hong Kong Electric launched an online tool called \u201cSmart EV Charge Easy Online Advisor\u201d in September 2016. After answering some simple questions, the online advisor will provide a tailor-made preliminary proposal for EV owners, incorporated owners or management offices.

Despite this, most of them were positive about the long-term future of EVs in Hong Kong. The main reasons included:\n\n- It is a global trend\n- More affordable and longer-range EV models are becoming available\n\nViews on the challenges inherent in building EV charging infrastructure:\n\nThe participating EV charging service providers expressed the view that the sustainability of charging service businesses (i.e. paid charging services) is in doubt, since the majority of public charging services are free. Some interviewees stated that although some incorporated owners are still hesitant to invest in or approve the installation of EV chargers, the situation is gradually improving as public awareness of EVs has grown over the past few years. In terms of technical challenges, some car parks lack sufficient electric power capacity to install more EV chargers. Some interviewees suggested that selecting a single standard for quick charging may reduce the initial investment costs, while others said that both CHAdeMO and CCS will still be needed in the near future.\n\nViews on catering for future EV charging infrastructure demand\n\nThe interviewees generally thought that upgrading standard chargers to medium or quick chargers is the correct direction in which to proceed. Apart from these upgrades, there is a need to install more DC quick chargers for public use, particularly in the New Territories. Most of the interviewees agreed that a centralised data platform is critical for sharing EV charging data such as the real-time status of individual charging units \u2013 this will allow stakeholders to tailor their products and services to EV users more effectively, and EV users will have a more convenient charging experience.

Therefore, installing home chargers is not a problem that can be simply solved by providing subsidies. Better coordination and more education are also important components.\n\n### Overseas experiences\n\n#### Industrial platforms\n\nThese days, it is quite common to find associations or industrial platforms formed by stakeholders that work together to harmonise common targets, goals and strategies for developing EV charging networks around the world. These stakeholders include governments, power companies, charging service providers, property management offices, universities, R&D institutes, EV user groups, building owner groups and more. Below are several examples of these platforms from the US, Mainland China, and Germany.\n\nUS \u2013 ROEV Association\nROEV Association is an EV industry trade association created to increase pe appeal of EVs by enabling charging network interoperability in pe U.S. This neutral collaboration of industry stakeholders was founded by BMW, CarCharging / Blink, ChargePoint, EVgo, and Nissan.

Establishing an industrial platform or association can also encourage data sharing among members, which can create more innovative businesses and services.\n\n### Engagement of the private sector\n\nMost of the markets looked at by this study accept that home charging is the most suitable everyday charging mode for EV users. The next option is to install EV chargers in workplaces or semi-public locations. The use of public EV chargers is the final option for those without home chargers, or to be used for opportunity charging. As Mainland China is the world\u2019s largest EV market, the Chinese Government announced a strategy called \u201cGuidelines for Developing Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure (2015\u2013 2020)\u201d under the China's 13th Five-Year Plan which, setting a mission of exploring sustainable business models, encourages private companies to become more involved and take up more responsibility for public and private charger infrastructure expansion \u2013 rather than relying on the government\u2019s resources alone.", "start_char_idx": 79940, "end_char_idx": 82510, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2967ddc-6cc6-47c2-badf-bc9d6b345d88": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2967ddc-6cc6-47c2-badf-bc9d6b345d88", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ef133e0-c32e-458b-8aae-8d7fbed2579b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "a590dcd150456a2e5d623f2a51a7ecf856f826153eff6330580accc0de435860", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c4f66085-0ebf-4631-8832-2a9bb47d105f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "8e8eb022dc80b67219e0c92d623e121fe1964bf07667474800b06881d3dc4142", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7156e2e3-edc2-4231-b5b3-483c8433d07a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "df545bc89aaaf9ee46d963019e97d56078fcd8c57cbc7eff58496eb295b27bab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "As such, the Chinese Government has targeted developing 500,000 public chargers and 4,300,000 private chargers to cater to a demand equivalent to 5,000,000 EVs by 2020. Similarly, in 2016, the US Government announced that it would unlock up to USD4.5 billion in loan guarantees and invite applications to support the commercial-scale deployment of innovative EV charging facilities. These large-scale, ambitious strategies prove that the private sector is destined to play a crucial role in the development of EV charging.\n\n### Emerging technologies\n\nA number of innovative EV charging technologies and solutions are emerging, and governments around the world are keen to put these technologies to work to create benefits for the public. In Federal action announced in the US, the government is laying the groundwork for big data analytics to inspire new EV charging solutions. In the Netherlands, a programme called \u201cLiving Lab Smart Charging\u201d has been established; this is an open platform that allows companies, universities, local and regional governments and grid operators to cooperate. Below, we will briefly introduce some EV charging technologies show promise in the near-term.\n\n#### Wireless charging\n\nWireless Electric Vehicle Charger (WEVC) is seen as a key enabling technology that can increase the EV adoption rate by providing a convenient and easy-to-use charging experience to users. WEVC transmits electrical energy from a transmitter coil on the ground to a receiver coil on an EV chassis through a highly-efficient energy transfer. SAE J2954 is to be tested in the next two years by vehicle automakers and was standardised at the end of 2018. This standardisation milestone was given by the industry to enable the commercialisation of wireless power transfers of up to 11kW by 2020.\n\n#### Smart power distribution (also known as load management)\n\nWhile EV penetration rates continue to rise and more EV charging facilities are built, the electrical systems (low-voltage distribution) in residential or commercial buildings may face the risk of overloading power lines and transformers and creating voltage drops.\n\nAs illustrated in the \u201cGlobal EV Outlook 2017\u201d publication, charging facilities can be scaled up in phases that follow the growth in EV numbers. Smart charging is needed at EV charging stations to ensure that the available power is shared among all the chargers at the station.", "start_char_idx": 82511, "end_char_idx": 84922, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7156e2e3-edc2-4231-b5b3-483c8433d07a": {"__data__": {"id_": "7156e2e3-edc2-4231-b5b3-483c8433d07a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ef133e0-c32e-458b-8aae-8d7fbed2579b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "a590dcd150456a2e5d623f2a51a7ecf856f826153eff6330580accc0de435860", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b2967ddc-6cc6-47c2-badf-bc9d6b345d88", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "0f03637d35ee7bbafe4abc4169e3b7f9722a26c300676548ecbcb78b175ff04c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "77b9b4a8-f41f-4592-ae59-357306cedc6a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "655037aa51b56bd16dd5375e5336fd03736d28301345aa306b7c62a47f116dae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In the third phase proposed in the publication, which sees a high demand for EV charging, the idea of smart charging is extended to the building level \u2013 this means that the available power in the entire building needs to be distributed between all the apartments in the building and the EV charging station.\n---\n## C H A P T E R 3\n\nIn Norway, the Innovative Charging Facility has been built in Oslo, the capital city. The facility consists of two fast chargers with up to 50kW of charging power and 100 flex chargers that provide up to 22kW of charging power. At night, residents of the area park and charge for free at a rate of 3.6kW. During the daytime, regular parking fees applies and the opportunity to choose faster charging is offered for a fee. A unique battery solution balances phase distortions and reduce peaks in the power grid. This means that EVs get more power at every charge point.\n\nIn the Netherlands\u2019s \u201cLiving Lab Smart Charging\u201d programme, all new charging stations that are currently being installed are \u2018smart charging ready\u2019, using proven standards. The Living Lab turns innovation, tests and research findings into international standards so that everyone can benefit from their smart charging experiences. For instance, one programme sees EV users earn money by charging their vehicles through wind power at night.\n\nMobile EV chargers\n\nMobile EV charger break free of the limitations of ordinary charging facilities, which for obvious reasons are required to stay in fixed locations. Mobile chargers can help provide flexible charging services to EVs when charging stations are not available. They can also provide emergency charging services for battery-drained EVs on the road.\n\nHigh-power charging\n\nIn recent years, EV industry technology is trending towards using high power charging, also known as ultra-fast charging, which increases the charging power from 150kW to 450kW; making the charging speed between three and nine times faster than existing 50kW quick chargers. With charging speeds that fast, the charging experience will be similar to refuelling at a gas station. The Charging Interface Initiative e.V. (CharIN e.V.) predicts that a driving range of 100km will be topped up within four minutes using 350kW high power charging for a private EV, as illustrated in Figure 3-5.", "start_char_idx": 84923, "end_char_idx": 87240, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77b9b4a8-f41f-4592-ae59-357306cedc6a": {"__data__": {"id_": "77b9b4a8-f41f-4592-ae59-357306cedc6a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ef133e0-c32e-458b-8aae-8d7fbed2579b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "a590dcd150456a2e5d623f2a51a7ecf856f826153eff6330580accc0de435860", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7156e2e3-edc2-4231-b5b3-483c8433d07a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "de0c2d260c8cf6eece9aa50f68322719a0d59c62dff0bed662fb86c002fd9c93", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d3301f61-5a61-4656-a8ef-6d9fe471fdb6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3b5dfed6ad988607469708d4befaa84c00b4036f124217ae45ef4ca87834ded8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "| |Home|Metropolitan|Highway|Long distance highway|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|min/100 km|50 kW|150 kW|350 kW|with consumption of 12.7kWh/100 km|\n| |CCS next level offers more flexibility in mobility| | | |\n\nFigure 3-5 Future charging practices by CharIN e.V\n\n54 Fortum, Fortum Charge & Drive opens an innovative charging facility for electric vehicles in Oslo, Norway, 2016, retrieved from https://www.fortum.com/media/2017/11/innovative-charging-facility-electric-vehicles-oslo-norway\n\n55 CharIN e.V., The path to a global charging standard, 2017, retrieved from http://www.charinev.org/fileadmin/Downloads/Presentations/2017_CharIN_Charge_Days_Bracklo.pdf\n---\n## CHAPTER 3\n\nThe Charging Interface Initiative e.V. is the major industrial promoter of high-power charging. CharIN e.V. is a registered association founded by Audi, BMW, Daimler, Mennekes, Opel, Phoenix Contact, Porsche, T\u00dcV S\u00dcD and Volkswagen. The members of CharIN e.V. span the entire supply chain of the EV charging industry and include EV manufacturers, EV charger manufacturers, service providers, charging cable manufacturers, semiconductor suppliers, testing equipment suppliers, and testing and certification bodies.\n\nIn November 2017, the BMW Group, Daimler AG, the Ford Motor Company and the Volkswagen Group, along with Audi and Porsche announced a joint venture called IONITY, which aims to develop and implement a High-Power Charging (HPC) network for EVs across Europe. Approximately 400 high power charging stations will be built by 2020 which offer multi-brand compatibility with current and future generations of EVs through the Combined Charging System (CCS). On the other side of the Atlantic, Electrify America will deploy 2,000 350kW CCS fast chargers across the US by the end of 2019.\n\nApart from the European and US CCS standard, the CHAdeMO Association in Japan released the latest protocol version of the CHAdeMO standard to support high-power charging up to 400kW.", "start_char_idx": 87242, "end_char_idx": 89194, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3301f61-5a61-4656-a8ef-6d9fe471fdb6": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3301f61-5a61-4656-a8ef-6d9fe471fdb6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ef133e0-c32e-458b-8aae-8d7fbed2579b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "a590dcd150456a2e5d623f2a51a7ecf856f826153eff6330580accc0de435860", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "77b9b4a8-f41f-4592-ae59-357306cedc6a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "9b985df2aa38c5f7ea05390253aebd333c0e20fe3b313fe1bc23ed6481d967a2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "398413ff-e564-4cd8-955c-904534ec60c4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "457656d14d9097baacbc54a5acfa11e533f762b4239cb16266c86c70d9329f69", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "These plans and actions reveal the industry\u2019s future high-power charging ambitions.\n\nInteroperability within EV charging networks\n\nWith IoT-compatible and interoperable charging platforms, EV users can charge easily, access real-time information about individual chargers and pay at any charging station. An interoperable EV charging network makes barrier-free electric mobility possible. In the US, the ROEV Association is a neutral collaboration of industry stakeholders designed to support EV adoption by facilitating public charging network interoperability. Its founding members are BMW of North America, Nissan, ChargePoint, NRG EVgo, and CarCharging/Blink. The Association\u2019s platform allows EV users to easily check information and access most public EV charging stations across multiple networks using one network account.\n\nIn the industry, the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP), a communication protocol, is gaining a significant amount of attention at the moment. The OCPP was developed by the Open Charge Alliance (OCA) and is a universal open solution for communications between EV chargers and any central system. With the OCPP, charging service providers can operate different brands of EV chargers, as long as they use the same communication protocol.\n\nIn addition to the OCPP, in Europe, the concept of eRoaming is currently being promoted. eRoaming platforms enable users to charge their vehicles at charging points which are run by different operators \u2013 similar to the way third-party network operators are used in telecommunications. For example, eRoaming offers EV users cross-operator billing processes, whether through a smartphone app, by card, or potentially through vehicle-based identification. Interoperable platforms like these make barrier-free electric mobility possible, with EV users able to easily charge and pay at any charging station anywhere in Europe.\n\nSimilarly, in 2017, the Open Fast Charge Alliance was founded to create, through roaming, a premium network of fast chargers all over Europe. The founding members of the Open Fast Charging Alliance include Fastned (the Netherlands), Sodetrel (France), Smatrics (Austria), Gr\u00f8nn Kontakt (Norway), and GOtthard FASTcharge (Switzerland). Together, the alliance members own and operate more than 500 fast chargers in six markets. They provide 24/7 customer service and ensure maximum network uptime.

The standard can facilitate interconnection across different charging service platforms and realize data exchanges between EV charging infrastructure networks. In Beijing, a public charging facility platform has been built to provide an open interconnection platform for service providers to connect their charging network to this open platform or even their individual chargers to the platform. This public service management platform uses IoT and big data analytics technology to support the construction of charging facilities in Beijing and to support the exchange of information between participating stakeholders.\n\n### Views and recommendations\n\nRecommendation 5: Create connections between stakeholders\n\nIn recent years, various activities have been held which include seminars, meetings, and various dialogue sessions, in which representatives of industry stakeholders have been keen to participate in order to communicate with one another. For example, APAS organized some events like the APAS R&D Centre Showcase and technology sharing seminars; and established communication platforms like EVSIG, which involved stakeholders from the local EV industry.

Key stakeholders include the Government, the two power companies, charging service providers, property management offices, universities, R&D institutes, and EV user groups.\n\nThis collaboration of stakeholders can also facilitate the sharing of frontline opinions and data. These important sets of data \u2013 the number and status of people using home chargers, for example \u2013 can allow the policymakers and the industry to leverage big data analytics and open data strategies to facilitate long-term planning of the distribution and density of the EV charging infrastructure in Hong Kong.\n\nA reference model for a possible platform is the Hong Kong Connected Vehicles Cluster (HKCVC), formed by the HKPC, which brings over 30 enterprises together from the automotive and accessories industry, mobile networks, and the transportation and infrastructure industries to stimulate knowledge exchange and business development among practitioners in the connected vehicles industry to tap into new business opportunities in this promising sector.\n\nRecommendation 6: Encourage private sector\u2019s participation and promote paid charging services\n\nSimilar to the HKSAR Government, most overseas governments have prioritized home charging as the most suitable and the most preferred daily charging method for general EV users. The second option is EV chargers at workplaces or semi-public locations. The third option is the use of public EV chargers for those without home chargers or for the purposes of opportunity charging. These government development strategies follow the above principles. However, the policymakers alone cannot make this prioritization strategy succeed.

Given the speed of change, the industry may hesitate to invest in research and development or adopt new technologies without clearly seeing the benefits of these investments. One consideration might be selecting dedicated demonstration sites which centralise the trial and demonstration of new EV charging technologies. This would facilitate more experience sharing and knowledge exchange among academic circles, and research and other industry sectors and aid the development of technology. These demonstration sites might also host exhibitions on emerging technologies, allowing these technologies to gain greater public acceptance when they are adopted in the community.\n\nKowloon East is one of the candidate sites for possible trials and demonstrations of new EV charging technologies. In the Government \u2019s 2015 Policy Address, the Chief Executive announced that Kowloon East would be used as a pilot site to explore the feasibility of developing a smart city. For years, the Energising Kowloon East Office (EKEO) has been encouraging academic and research institutes to use Kowloon East as a test bed for developing innovative smart city solutions.

Since then, various wireless charging methods have been applied, like inductive coupling, magnetic resonance coupling, microwave and laser radiation, and others. Induction chargers use an induction coil to create an alternating electromagnetic field from a charging base, while a second induction coil in a portable device draws power from the electromagnetic field and converts it back into an electric current to charge a battery. Two induction coils in close proximity combine to form an electrical transformer. Greater distances between the sender and receiver coils can be achieved when the inductive charging system uses magnetic resonant coupling, which involves two copper coils being tuned to resonate at the same natural frequency \u2013 like two wine glasses which vibrate when a specific note is sung. The coils are placed a few feet apart. One coil is connected to an electric current, which generates a magnetic field that causes the second coil to resonate.\n\n|Power Source|Oscillator|Resonant Circuit|Rectifier|Load|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Figure 4-1|Diagram of the basic concept of resonant inductive coupling in a wireless power transfer system| | | |\n\nThis magnetic resonance results in the invisible transfer of electric energy through the air from the first coil to the receiving coil.

One of the most active players in stationary and dynamic charging is the wireless technology company Qualcomm, which recently developed and tested one of the world\u2019s first DEVC test tracks.\n\nThe feasibility study system is capable of charging an EV dynamically at up to 20 kW at highway speeds (100 km/h). Qualcomm also demonstrated simultaneous charging, in which two vehicles on the same track can charge dynamically at the same time. The vehicles are able to charge in both directions along the track, and even in reverse. Qualcomm is now in discussions with infrastructure stakeholders, power companies, city planners, traffic planners, car park owners and other ecosystem stakeholders regarding the implementation of DEVC. However, any roll out of equipment is still some time away.\n\n#### Fast wireless EV charging\n\nFast wireless EV charging is expected to deliver charging power of over 50kW. The growth of this type of charging is being driven by huge incentives from governments for the installation of fast chargers and public charging infrastructure subsidies. The increasing demand for commercial EVs is also contributing to the growth of high-power charging supply, since electric buses and electric trucks require a heavy power supply of more than 50kW to charge their high-capacity batteries.\n\n### Smart power distribution technologies for EVs\n\n#### Power distribution technology\n\nEffective power distribution can charge more EVs without the need for major infrastructure upgrades. Instead of installing additional physical electrical capacity, power distribution system can dynamically share existing power across more EV chargers in order to charge more EVs.\n\nThe aim of an effective power distribution system is to dynamically control the power of EV chargers according to the electricity loading of the building and thus to maximise the power utilisation of the building. The system can individually regulate the power supply of each charger according to its power demand, so as to harness potential unused capacity and in turn to facilitate the use of more chargers.", "start_char_idx": 108622, "end_char_idx": 111151, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab9c1fa2-9545-4a25-a460-80c4acf1b722": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab9c1fa2-9545-4a25-a460-80c4acf1b722", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ef133e0-c32e-458b-8aae-8d7fbed2579b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "a590dcd150456a2e5d623f2a51a7ecf856f826153eff6330580accc0de435860", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "06929180-cc5b-4d93-8662-e08364e6bc7f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "68c5ace7389616232ac8c9c5add685ae9d5b603f8627d6210bbb5b13c58cb1cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c4b51a0a-85de-42a9-9960-9f2f0949c018", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a5523591255106f15b54d27192aadc54b7272a343dd0689f288860fe55e5b4c6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "68 SAE, Wireless Power Transfer for Light-Duty Plug-In/Electric Vehicles and Alignment Methodology J2954_201711, 2017, retrieved from https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j2954_201711/\n\n69 Charged, Dynamic wireless charging: What\u2019s feasible?

Even though power companies are able to supply extra power transformers, space limitations often prevent the installation of more EV chargers. The dynamic charging power system analyses the historical and real-time electricity loading data of residential, public and other car park zones, as well as the load profile trend, to forecast the maximum power available for EV charging. The system can adjust the loading of each charger effectively and continuously according to the demand.\n\n### 4.2.2 Battery integrated charging solutions\n\nEV charging stations which integrate renewable energy and second-life batteries is an emerging technology which can support the deployment of high power EV chargers. Renewable Energy (RE) sources can provide green energy, while also supporting the export of power to the grid when the generation of RE exceeds demand. Second life batteries are integrated into these systems to serve as an energy buffer and provide emergency energy upon potential loss of the grid connection.\n\n### 4.2.3 Benefits and business opportunities\n\nThe growth in the number of EVs may have a significant impact on the peak demand of the electricity distribution network of a city. Generally, most EV charging takes place in the evenings. Uncoordinated charging of a large number of EVs could result in excessive demand spikes that occur for just a few hours a day, while demand in the remaining parts of the day remains unaffected. This situation could have far-reaching consequences for all the stakeholders involved. There may be grid congestion due to power peaks and voltage drops. There may also be an increase in electricity costs due to the expenses involved in the generation of extra power and grid reinforcement.", "start_char_idx": 111153, "end_char_idx": 113465, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4b51a0a-85de-42a9-9960-9f2f0949c018": {"__data__": {"id_": "c4b51a0a-85de-42a9-9960-9f2f0949c018", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ef133e0-c32e-458b-8aae-8d7fbed2579b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "a590dcd150456a2e5d623f2a51a7ecf856f826153eff6330580accc0de435860", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ab9c1fa2-9545-4a25-a460-80c4acf1b722", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "3545bd8f29398184b9fec63d93812d10ec98b36f3314fd5643ff221b1a5c5614", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2e5714af-b2d0-4621-a168-e469bc47a177", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a742645914c516b8f25adb115b1815379fffe908add913bf1ddaa14502cb2c3a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Such drawbacks can be overcome when EV charging is well managed so as to make better use of the available power generation and grid capacity.

In a standard connection between an electricity grid and a vehicle, power flows from the grid to the vehicle and charges the vehicle\u2019s battery. The implementation of V2G requires communications technologies and algorithms which sense grid status, determines whether vehicles should be providing or drawing electricity from the grid at any given time, ascertain the status and availability of vehicles that can provide the services needed, and track the services provided by vehicles so that owners can be paid for making their vehicles available.\n\n76 National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Critical Elements of Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) Economics, 2017, retrieved from https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy17osti/69017.pdf\n\n77 National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Critical Elements of Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) Economics, 2017, retrieved from https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy17osti/69017.pdf\n---\n## C H A P T E R 4\n\n4.3.2 Benefits and business opportunities\n\nIn addition to being a device for travel, EVs can also act as very large energy storage devices.

The EV can also work as an emergency backup power supply for the home during blackouts or brown outs.\n\nFor V2G system, if most of the EVs in the city charge during off-peak hours, the energy stored in EVs can be used as a power source for the power grid during peak hours.

Now, it is not only computers and smart phones that are connected to the Internet, but household appliances, smart devices and vehicles. A new term has recently surfaced: the \u201cConnected Vehicle\u201d, or CV. Connected Vehicles are sometimes referred to as the \u201cInternet of Vehicles\u201d, or IoV, as well.\n\nCVs involve an integration of three networks: an inter-vehicle network, an intra-vehicle network and a vehicular-based mobile Internet. With three networks integrated into one, CVs are essentially large-scale distributed systems for wireless communications and V2X information exchanges; where \u201cX\u201d can be vehicles, roads, people and networks. These V2X exchanges take place according to agreed communication protocols and data interaction standards, with examples including the IEEE 802.11p WAVE standard and, potentially, cellular technologies. CVs can create an integrated network for supporting intelligent traffic management, intelligent dynamic information services and intelligent vehicle control, representing a typical application of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in an intelligent transportation system (ITS).\n\nWhat kinds of technologies are involved in a typical CV? Basically, CVs are equipped with Internet access via Wi-Fi or cellular network such as GSM, HSDPA, LTE telecommunications technologies or the 5G networks that are expected to be deployed and supported by 2020. Other short-range communications technologies are also employed. Once the vehicle is connected to the Internet, it can communicate with a back-end cloud system to access a number of different services, such as automated emergency calls, navigation services, real-time traffic messages and many others.\n\nAt the core of the CV is the vehicular Global ID (GID) terminal. This is the vehicle\u2019s communication gateway which operates from an integrated or mounted terminal which has global, ubiquitous network connectivity.", "start_char_idx": 135009, "end_char_idx": 137531, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f609071c-8303-4198-ae1a-7581c19147df": {"__data__": {"id_": "f609071c-8303-4198-ae1a-7581c19147df", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ef133e0-c32e-458b-8aae-8d7fbed2579b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "a590dcd150456a2e5d623f2a51a7ecf856f826153eff6330580accc0de435860", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ab967cf1-7f58-4a67-951d-e2a500987c5d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "d4c64feb1af6556382be3f8e4cb90d59b56073f5d0f62714438b732089b51e19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e4bb2396-444f-4eac-9d66-8dc70158b256", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "38bca85cffa8cad9a51e721ddd184dfdc635aa006ca2ecb244a108920a457fcf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "It is also an intelligent in-vehicle sensor with global positioning and global online identification (essentially an \u201conline license plate\u201d) functionality.

An \u201cin-vehicle eCall\u201d is an emergency call (an E112 wireless call) generated either manually by the vehicle occupants by pushing a button, or automatically via the activation of in-vehicle sensors after a crash.

business opportunities\n\n### 4.4.2.1 Charging management and parking reservations\n\nThe Internet of Things is now an important and growing part of the parking industry. Apps that guide you to a parking space give information on the status of car parks, while parking management systems notify parking enforcement staff about violators.\n\nIn terms of CVs, optimal parking lot recommendations can be made based on driver behaviours and subjective demands. Candidate parking lots can be screened, based on users' subjective parking demands (e.g. they are looking for a parking lot with an EV charging station), and processed through multiple attribute decision making. This means that the most suitable parking lots can be recommended to drivers, who can then immediately book a parking spot at the chosen lot online.\n\n### 4.4.2.2 Fleet management for commercial EVs\n\nFleet management is defined as the management of commercial vehicles. Aspects of fleet management include vehicle financing, vehicle maintenance, vehicle telematics (Internet-based tracking and diagnostics), driver management, speed management, fuel management, and health and safety management. In the CV environment, real-time information on tracking, diagnostics, and fuel management can be uploaded to a cloud server at the fleet management center for processing, which will improve logistics efficiency, productivity, and allow for predictive fleet maintenance.\n\nThe fleet database can be set up to notify fleet managers on matters such as annual vehicle examinations, traffic violations and tickets, and renewal of insurance. Additionally, a driving profile can be set up for drivers, including such categories as average speed, frequency of detours, duration and frequency of breaks, rigorousness of maneuvers, and even gear shift positions.

For private vehicles, CVs help drivers schedule and arrange predictive maintenance by connecting the vehicle to the maintenance service provider's server. Real-time information on vehicle diagnostics will then be uploaded to the maintenance service provider, allowing them to order spare parts or any other items necessary for maintenance procedures.\n\n### 4.4.2.4 Driving behavior analysis\n\nIn a CV environment, big data technologies offer new solutions to improve traffic safety and efficiency by tracking and recording driving data which allows for analysis and evaluation of driving behavior. Potential features and applications of the system will remind drivers to improve any poor driving behaviors, and perhaps refer them to personalized vehicle insurance policies or active safety applications.\n\n### 4.4.2.5 Insurance\n\nAs discussed above, driving behavior analysis data can offer CV drivers references to personalized vehicle insurance policies. These will create new opportunities for insurance companies, such as Usage-Based Insurance (UBI) and its two variants: \"Pay As You Drive\" (PAYD) and \"Pay How You Drive\" (PHYD). Usage-Based Insurance began as an effort to collect data to enhance insurance ratings and billing revenue. The concept of PAYD applies to the quantity of an individual's driving \u2013 that is, the amount of the insurance charged is based on their actual usage of the vehicle. This pricing model is analogous to metered billing for electricity charges. PHYD, on the other hand, is based on the quality or style of an individual's driving. This model takes\n---\n## C H A P T E R 4\n\ninto consideration a person\u2019s driving style and driving behaviour to determine whether a driver is aggressive or makes good decisions while driving. UBI provides an opportunity to enhance current practices by saving lives, making a positive impact on society, helping the economy, and protecting the environment.

Real-time information on the vehicle\u2019s location and speed can be uploaded to traffic management systems to help traffic information providers to broadcast accurate information.\n\n### 4.4.2.7 Infotainment\n\nCVs can also offer new infotainment options by delivering popular content to passengers. Today, vehicle entertainment is mostly confined to FM radio and Bluetooth connectivity. However, as high-speed networks come into mainstream use, popular high bandwidth streaming services may become available in connected vehicles. Passengers will then have much broader digital content choices. For example, Apple and Google are currently competing to becoming the \u201cbrains\u201d behind in-car infotainment. Apple\u2019s CarPlay function embeds the familiar iOS experience into a vehicle\u2019s dashboard, which in turn gives access to a variety of third-party apps available in the Apple App Store. Android Auto can also stream music from Google Play Music straight into a connected vehicle. The system also allows a driver to access their preferred apps and content in the vehicle.\n\nPassengers can also purchase or rent media on the go.\n\n### 4.4.3 Future development\n\n#### 4.4.3.1 Enabling the development of technology\n\nCVs are dependent on reliable and secure networks for their operation, but there are two main technical issues which need to be tackled: network speed and capacity and cyber security.\n\nBeyond cost and security considerations, both in terms of data privacy and the potential for hacking, the speed of the network to which they are connected presents a bottleneck preventing CVs from reaching their full potential.

By 2025, it is predicted that 67 million automotive 5G vehicle subscriptions will be active.\n\nOn the cyber security front, once vehicles are connected to the Internet, new opportunities for hackers can arise. A secure environment is absolutely necessary for IoV development and road safety. The security risks of IoV are centred on five aspects: CVs themselves, V2X communications, data security, intelligent devices, and service platforms; with the first three items mostly related to the vehicles.\n\n103 Forbes, How Will Consumers Benefit From Connected Cars?, 2016, retrieved from https://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2016/06/06/how-will-consumers-benefit-from-connected-cars/#4f303dd24a05\n\n104 GSMA, The Road to 5G and the Rise of Connected Cars, 2017, retrieved from https://www.gsma.com/iot/news/road-5g-rise-connected-cars/\n\n105 www.gov.cn, 5G\u5957\u9910\u4f86\u4e86, 2019, retrieved from http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2019-10/31/content_5447177.htm#1\n\n106 Telefonica, Infographic: Connected cars by 5G, 2017, retrieved from https://iot.telefonica.com/blog/infographic-connected-cars-by-5g\n---\n## C H A P T E R 4\n\nCV cyber security elements include the Electronic Control Unit (ECU), the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, the Telematics Box (T-Box), the on-board operating system, the on-board diagnostics (OBD) interface and the In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) system.", "start_char_idx": 155401, "end_char_idx": 157204, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da0136b6-67b0-4a6f-ae9a-56fefea9c492": {"__data__": {"id_": "da0136b6-67b0-4a6f-ae9a-56fefea9c492", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ef133e0-c32e-458b-8aae-8d7fbed2579b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "a590dcd150456a2e5d623f2a51a7ecf856f826153eff6330580accc0de435860", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "11abde02-878e-4c2b-a56c-363d008bb839", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "c1a417038d27a6111a8e64e315a8a451c622bade607f445d5b0d421df75766a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c8366181-606b-44c9-b5e9-4d11d2ea05f2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1a0f746741989790b3c8913c6dc29a03712309be2c3375c3ed64f2c12956fb84", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Hackers may be able to attack the connected vehicle through an over-the-air firmware upgrade, through illegal data injection, illegal device access, \u201cman-in-the-middle\u201d attack, and other means.

In addition, odometry universally suffers from precision problems, since wheels tend to slip and slide over the ground, creating variations in distance when compared to wheel rotations. These errors are compounded when the vehicle operates on non-smooth surfaces. Odometry readings become increasingly unreliable over time as these errors accumulate and compound.\n\nVisual odometry, on the other hand, is the process of determining equivalent odometry information using sequential camera images to estimate the distance travelled.

Autonomous vehicles must have control systems that are capable of analysing sensory data to distinguish other cars on the road. While the design details vary, most self-driving systems create and maintain an internal map of their surroundings. Software then processes those inputs, plots a path and sends instructions to the vehicle\u2019s \u201cactuators\u201d, which control acceleration, braking and steering. Hard-coded rules, obstacle avoidance algorithms, predictive modelling, and \u201csmart \u201d object discrimination \u2013 for example identifying the difference between a bicycle and a motorcycle \u2013 help the control system follow traffic rules and navigate obstacles. Partially autonomous vehicles may require a human driver to intervene if the system encounters uncertainty; while fully autonomous vehicles may not even have a steering wheel. Self-driving cars can be further distinguished as being \u201cconnected\u201d or not, indicating whether they can communicate with other vehicles and/or traffic infrastructure, such as next generation traffic lights.

It is the technology involved in sending, receiving and storing information relating to remote objects \u2013 like vehicles \u2013 via telecommunication devices.

It is possible to create a competent self-driving car which uses an older internal combustion engine as the power source. However, there are six compelling reasons that explain why it is most likely that self-driving cars will be overwhelmingly electric \u2013 that is, six reasons why the two technologies are destined to merge:\n\n1. Technology-focused early adopters want both innovations in the same vehicle\n\nAutomotive innovations are expensive, and they generally are seen in premium cars first. The types of early adopters that can afford such price premiums often identify \u201ctechnological differentiation\u201d as their incentive, which means they want automakers to include both electric and self-driving features in the same car, as in the new Mercedes-Benz S Class. As these innovations eventually trickle down and become more affordable, the initial pairing demanded by early adopters usually carries through to the mass market as well.\n2.", "start_char_idx": 173361, "end_char_idx": 175554, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "98725669-808c-42b7-a22b-8d092376428a": {"__data__": {"id_": "98725669-808c-42b7-a22b-8d092376428a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ef133e0-c32e-458b-8aae-8d7fbed2579b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "a590dcd150456a2e5d623f2a51a7ecf856f826153eff6330580accc0de435860", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b01d9305-703f-42c4-9b30-8844186c0490", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "fb2a1735acfa52fd74f0252ad0a5337d76d9dd736239a75af16cd1e4f7ab6f42", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7287393d-0b75-419c-96ff-dea6d5797110", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a92934d72e3601acc0b04c453fe180ed4dbb60e8070875f2d37b406621ac24fa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "2. It is easier to implement autonomous features on EVs\n\nBetween the multitude of sensors required and their advanced on-board computing hardware and software, self-driving cars require more power from a vehicle\u2019s electrical subsystem. Today, ICE engines still largely use 12V electrical systems, running off a single lead-acid battery. The higher voltages and energy stored in an EV battery pack allow much more design freedom when it comes to implementing self-driving hardware and software. It is also simpler to control an electric motor and battery pack than an internal combustion engine, with its thousands of moving parts and complex cabling (\u201cdrive by wire\u201d technology, for example, is a more natural fit for EVs). Indeed, in their prototyping of autonomous vehicle features, General Motors, Nissan and Google have each opted to use EVs as a starting platform.\n3. Wireless charging integrates seamlessly with autonomy\n\nA self-driving car will have a very hard time refilling its tank with gasoline. The process would either require the driver, or a gas station attendant, or a robot to do it. Wireless charging, which is now coming to the market for some plug-ins from Audi, Toyota and other brands, eliminates this problem. An autonomous vehicle can drive itself to an available parking spot, align itself properly and self-charge using wireless charging. Moreover, it can move itself away from the charging pad when charging has been completed, allowing for a higher utilisation rate of the charging infrastructure, whereas EVs that are not self-driving would be stuck in position until their owners moved them. Wireless charging is also more efficient when vehicles are properly aligned \u2013 and self-driving cars will be able to park themselves optimally every time, thus ensuring the highest possible wireless charging efficiency. Finally, autonomous vehicles enable \u201copportunistic charging\u201d: rather than waiting until a battery pack is nearly drained, a vehicle can charge itself when it is between driving tasks.\n\nLux Research, Six Reasons Why Electric Vehicles and Autonomous Vehicles Will Inevitably Merge, 2016\n---\n## C H A P T E R 4\n\n4) More efficient self-driving extends range, which is an EV pain point\nAll developers of EVs continue to struggle with \u201crange anxiety\u201d, and any technologies that can extend driving\nrange are warmly welcomed in the field.", "start_char_idx": 175552, "end_char_idx": 177924, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7287393d-0b75-419c-96ff-dea6d5797110": {"__data__": {"id_": "7287393d-0b75-419c-96ff-dea6d5797110", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ef133e0-c32e-458b-8aae-8d7fbed2579b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "a590dcd150456a2e5d623f2a51a7ecf856f826153eff6330580accc0de435860", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "98725669-808c-42b7-a22b-8d092376428a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "ab4d90820d58bdc1c9fa72018ea1f592e49e7f68d3e3f7e12251449e540b01a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "80ee9207-7a42-4ccf-aa68-7ef0fbb47004", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2fe72d7acfef9b4d0cb7259d47f56541f247e9096ca869c6ec22e8fca0f11039", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Early studies indicate that self-driving technology may improve driving\nefficiency by five to ten per cent, thanks to smoother braking and acceleration, as well as more logical coasting\nand regenerative braking brought about by advanced mapping and predictive algorithms.

In February 2017, the Ministry of Transport introduced a series of Autonomous Vehicle Rules, or \u201cAV Rules\u201d, for prospective trials of SDVs. With the amendment to the Road Traffic Act, the Singaporean law now recognises that motor vehicles don\u2019t require human drivers, making it the first world country to widely adopt autonomous driving. Also, the ministry limited the regulatory sandbox for AVs to 2022, but the Ministry will consider enacting more permanent legislation or return to Parliament to further extend the period of the sandbox.\n\nSingapore has been pushing hard on AV development. The Centre of Excellence for Testing and Research of Autonomous Vehicles (CETRAN) at Nanyang Technological University was launched on November 2017, which has a test town for driverless vehicles complete with traffic lights, bus stops, skyscrapers and a rain-making machine to offer realistic testing conditions.\n\nIn addition to this, it is also planning real-world field tests with driverless buses and shuttles in three areas (Punggol, Tengah and the Jurong Innovation District) for off-peak and on-demand commuting from 2022, and it is working with the Netherlands on an international standard for AVs.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

However, the widespread use and adoption of fully autonomous vehicles first requires a number of important and inter-related challenges to be solved. These are listed below.\n\n1. Both technology and business models have yet to become mature\n\nWhile technological experts are in a race to develop a working autonomous vehicle, the ideas regarding how these vehicles will be used are remarkably undeveloped. What roles will autonomous vehicles play in future transportation? How will users pay for transportation? Will users pay for services, or will they own the vehicles? If ridesharing companies can \u201ccommoditise\u201d automobiles such that consumers no longer care what type of vehicle will take them from point A to point B, the majority of consumers will no longer purchase cars and only spend their money on ridesharing services instead. This will radically change the sets of profit pools across the entire automotive industry.\n2. Regulation and legislative framework\n\nThe presence of an appropriate regulatory and legislative framework is critical to the sustained success of autonomous vehicles. A stable regulatory environment allows companies to plan early and avoid making risky investments in ideas that could face legal challenges further down the road. Such an environment also builds the confidence of organisations and citizens in autonomous vehicles. On the path to creating an appropriate regulatory and legislative framework, testing is key to fully understanding the opportunities and risks associated with autonomous vehicles. Drivers will also need to be retrained and retested and as a result, education for drivers will need to be radically overhauled.\n3. Changes to insurance\n\nAutonomous vehicles will present a number of particularly complex problems for the insurance sector. First, insurance providers will need to design products that are suitable for owners and operators of autonomous vehicles. They will also have to cater to the users of new mobility services.", "start_char_idx": 198631, "end_char_idx": 201187, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9244eeac-84c3-4881-9db4-a992798cac7e": {"__data__": {"id_": "9244eeac-84c3-4881-9db4-a992798cac7e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ef133e0-c32e-458b-8aae-8d7fbed2579b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "a590dcd150456a2e5d623f2a51a7ecf856f826153eff6330580accc0de435860", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3268fd36-95ce-4e34-993f-f3a03cca3fc9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "661a9ffc42ee453b00834c3258be64d075bc6ae7482036635f8f243c584493bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3d19d4d0-442e-4692-91b1-af58a6e88a45", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4e6304286b0355e0dbef605161d8d1e4c42819ca1294e3aeb13a006bd373d102", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "They will also have to cater to the users of new mobility services. At the moment, these providers are comparatively immature when it comes to assessing the risks of autonomous vehicles. Given the array of potential new uses for autonomous vehicles, there will be new vehicle users who were not previously considered eligible to drive. Insurers will have to assess how to cover these new risks.\n4. Investment in infrastructure\n\nThe rollout of fully autonomous vehicles is related to two basic infrastructure requirements: road infrastructure and telecoms infrastructure. First, better maintenance of road infrastructure is fundamental, as this will allow autonomous vehicle technology to read the road. Second, fully connective data service coverage across the road network is essential. Meeting these requirements will necessitate a significant increase in infrastructure investment.\n\nReferences:\n\n|150|Transport Department, Guidance Notes on the Trials of Autonomous Vehicles, 2019, retrieved from https://www.td.gov.hk/filemanager/en/content_4808/guidance%20notes%20on%20the%20trials%20of%20autonomous%20vehicles%20eng.pdf|\n|---|---|\n|151|TechCrunch, Business models will drive the future of autonomous vehicles, 2017, retrieved from https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/25/business-models-will-drive-the-future-of-autonomous-vehicles/|\n|152|PA Consulting Group, How long is the road to driverless vehicles?, 2017, retrieved from http://www2.paconsulting.com/CAV-Report-UK_Nordics-Report.html?_ga=2.57445098.1108061862.1515999998-1782367202.1515999998|\n---\n## C H A P T E R 4\n\n4.5.3.2 Autonomous vehicles development in Hong Kong\n\nAccording to the \u201cReport of the Consultancy Study on the Smart City Blueprint for Hong Kong\u201d, conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers Advisory Services Hong Kong Limited (PwC), despite the fact that autonomous vehicles pilot projects are being conducted at Hong Kong International Airport, Science Park and the Lok Ma Chau Loop, and despite the fact that the Road Traffic Ordinance is being revised; all these are planned to conclude between 2021 and 2025.", "start_char_idx": 201120, "end_char_idx": 203200, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d19d4d0-442e-4692-91b1-af58a6e88a45": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d19d4d0-442e-4692-91b1-af58a6e88a45", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ef133e0-c32e-458b-8aae-8d7fbed2579b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "a590dcd150456a2e5d623f2a51a7ecf856f826153eff6330580accc0de435860", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9244eeac-84c3-4881-9db4-a992798cac7e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "345660f04ae304d7fe14ab17a38cbebe4309763f38b0f152e1f467bdc589fe6b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "75b563dd-aded-48b5-ae0b-3ea2f52ba646", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3a257bacb8420dc15c5c698f12406052ffcac9846d8b2fc4e66b8cd2d3112157", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The fact is that policies related to autonomous vehicles in Hong Kong are far behind other international cities.

In general, Hong Kong EV dealerships provide a full maintenance and service package to their customers when they purchase a new EV. As most EVs are fairly new, they are mostly still under warranty and thus, the EV drivers surveyed have not yet encountered many maintenance or service issues.\n\nWhen the warranty provided by these dealerships expires, many EV owners may want to switch to a qualified independent service garage which can carry out EV servicing and repair. The EV owners have the expectation that these independent service garages will save their time and money in contrast to having to take their vehicle back to the dealership whenever there is a problem.

EVs have fewer moving mechanical parts than Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles, which means that in general, EVs have a smaller number of components in need of regular maintenance and repair. Several EV dealerships were interviewed in the course of this study, as we solicited their opinions and comments on the EV maintenance and service situation in Hong Kong.\n\nAccording to the interviewees, the following EV issues are usually handled by EV dealerships when they maintain or repair their customers\u2019 vehicles:\n\n- High voltage traction battery pack and battery management system;\n- Electric air conditioning system;\n- Accessories which are not related to the EV drivetrain, for example, body, lights, windows, tires and others.\n\nFor commercial EVs in Hong Kong, the vehicle usage rates are very high. Dealerships therefore have to carry out regular maintenance diagnoses more frequently for commercial EVs than for non-commercial EVs. Dealerships need to perform major check-ups for commercial EVs approximately every two months; and minor check-ups are also needed in the months where major check-ups are not conducted. The difficulty of obtaining parts and accessories for replacement in a timely manner is one of the major problems faced by these dealerships; occasionally, they may need to wait as long as a few weeks for the necessary parts and accessories to arrive.\n\nCurrently, the cost of maintaining an EV is comparatively higher than the cost of maintaining a gasoline-powered or diesel-powered vehicle. It also takes longer to conduct regular check-ups or diagnosis problems in EVs. The primary reasons for this are a lack of experienced EV mechanics who can perform these tasks efficiently, and a lack of immediately-available parts and accessories for replacement. However, due to the relative simplicity of EVs, most dealerships agree that the maintenance and repair costs for EVs will decrease at some point in the future. Similarly, EV repair and maintenance times should also decrease in the future. The simplicity of the electric motor that drives most EVs means that it contains less moving parts, as compared to the hundreds of moving parts in an internal combustion engine.", "start_char_idx": 209242, "end_char_idx": 211711, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba838e69-789f-4780-a0b7-bdba13110c0c": {"__data__": {"id_": "ba838e69-789f-4780-a0b7-bdba13110c0c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ef133e0-c32e-458b-8aae-8d7fbed2579b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "a590dcd150456a2e5d623f2a51a7ecf856f826153eff6330580accc0de435860", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b3a62437-1031-41d0-9096-a6854bad5147", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "077226ada52b93e881ba5603c4a87a6dd397ec7e5d988a5de2550135ad1b45d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "14021fab-f033-4700-9c5b-ac62f0cca0f7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a3e8b6420e2963faa14022c8fcc0d3d4e4eb33c082ca996855e070050ee6c728", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "There are simply not as many parts in an EV motor that can wear out and, when they do, they will be relatively simple to replace or repair.\n\nTo maintain a typical EV in the future, according to various estimations, will cost about one-third of the current cost of maintaining a typical internal combustion engine vehicle.

Graduates from these institutions should be equipped with the necessary knowledge and techniques for EV maintenance and service. It is also recommended adding an EV service category to the \u201cVoluntary Registration Scheme for Vehicle Mechanics\u201d, as this will ensure that EV mechanics possess the necessary qualifications and experience to maintain EVs. All EV mechanics should be properly trained and certified so that their qualifications and competence will gain recognition. In addition, all EV manufacturers should release maintenance guides and the required maintenance tools to the training institutions.\n\nThe general opinion is that if more independent EV service garages are available, it will benefit the entire Hong Kong EV market. APAS has set up the EVSIG, the stakeholders will be able to share their insights and opinions on developing the EV maintenance and service industry in Hong Kong.

The lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery is the most costly part of an EV and has the most value for recycle and reuse. However, the other vehicle parts and accessories which are made from different materials such as plastic (bumpers, tires), metal (the vehicle body and motor), the auxiliary battery and others, are also worth recycling, as they will maximise the use of resources and protect the environment.\n\nWhen recycling EV accessories, the first consideration is the ease with which the vehicle\u2019s structure can be dismantled. Many car manufacturers actually consider the ease of dismantling during the vehicle\u2019s design stage. Recycling companies then dismantle the accessories and classify them into different materials. After sorting the materials, they will be passed to shredding companies for shredding into smaller pieces. The materials can then be recycled and reused for other items.\n\n#### 6.1.2 Battery recycling\n\nMost EV batteries were initially Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries, the predominant chemical compound used in HEV batteries. The first wave of HEV NiMH batteries are now reaching the end of their lives. Next, Li-ion batteries, used in more recent EVs, will also be dismantled soon. Whether NiMH or Li-ion based batteries, a strong economic incentive for recycling exists, since valuable materials such as nickel, cobalt and lithium can be sorted and recycled.\n\nIn general, in order to extract the useful metals from Li-ion batteries, a recycling company typically dismantles a battery into its components and then reduces these components into either small pieces or powders. The various materials are sorted by a separation process and then put through a chemical treatment, like a hydrometallurgy treatment, to extract the rare metals. However, there is still plenty of room for Li-ion battery recycling methods to be improved.", "start_char_idx": 233249, "end_char_idx": 235324, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c65cab3d-c9f2-4140-a99d-480f531ad369": {"__data__": {"id_": "c65cab3d-c9f2-4140-a99d-480f531ad369", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ef133e0-c32e-458b-8aae-8d7fbed2579b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "a590dcd150456a2e5d623f2a51a7ecf856f826153eff6330580accc0de435860", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "06ad8cbf-3004-47c8-82f2-2fc5fde097a8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "7073db01bb32f4942a706cdad6bc399eab0033e1546b9b21eb07a0944d27fcc3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "81555ed1-50d4-4954-a712-d1f3cc914018", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "94e5a893f67037f3661eeef71077e4b65c0fb7371b3d1d6b103f1fb28755ef65", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "However, there is still plenty of room for Li-ion battery recycling methods to be improved.\n\n157 Environmental Protection Department, EV models in Hong Kong, 2019, retrieved from https://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/english/environmentinhk/air/prob_solutions/promotion_ev.html\n---\n## C H A P T E R 6\n\n6.1.3 Second life batteries\n\nMost EVs require and use very high performance batteries. Once the capacity of these batteries declines below to 80 per cent, they are swapped out for new ones. However, these retired batteries still have many charge and discharge cycles left in them, making them useful for storage and other applications.\n\nSecond life applications can delay the disposal of batteries that still have energy storage value. Their potential applications include solar panel energy storage, wind power storage, UPS power packs and many others.\n\nBefore utilising a battery for a second life application, its quality has to be checked. A typical quality analysis is based on a components test and an analysis of the data stored in the battery management software. If more data is available, the battery\u2019s state of health can be determined more precisely. The methodology for checking and classifying a battery\u2019s decommissioning should be standardised to effectively identify the battery\u2019s quality which will enable it to be matched with the appropriate second life application.\n\n6.2 Second life of EV batteries\n\n6.2.1 The reuse challenge\n\nThe state of any individual battery\u2019s health is dependent on what they have been exposed to and how they have been treated over the course of their life thus far. The health of a battery pack as a whole depends on the health of each of the battery modules, which in turn are dependent on the health of the battery cells. To successfully re-use an EV battery and give it a second life means standardising the quality of used batteries and having procedures in place to maintain their safety.\n\n|Cell|Module|Pack|\n|---|---|---|\n|Figure 6-1 Example of a battery cell, module and pack|Figure 6-1 Example of a battery cell, module and pack|Figure 6-1 Example of a battery cell, module and pack|\n\nSecond life batteries are a relatively new industry and business models are still developing.", "start_char_idx": 235233, "end_char_idx": 237454, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81555ed1-50d4-4954-a712-d1f3cc914018": {"__data__": {"id_": "81555ed1-50d4-4954-a712-d1f3cc914018", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ef133e0-c32e-458b-8aae-8d7fbed2579b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "a590dcd150456a2e5d623f2a51a7ecf856f826153eff6330580accc0de435860", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c65cab3d-c9f2-4140-a99d-480f531ad369", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "478781eb4c2ca4dcd5f8ed53faadd5e18b88f85ef73450a40ac1e4a90a6115d7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2d6802b0-8e89-45fb-94eb-91f46ddcec6e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "380aabdc2198736b45bf445e4308bde199ee5b909ea41392d7071ab419995e25", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Although it is widely recognised that there is a large potential market, second life batteries still face many technical problems and challenges.\n\nThe current major challenges to giving Li-ion batteries a second life are:\n\n- Difficulties in identifying the exact chemical composition of individual batteries;\n- A lack of proper guidelines on the safe dismantling of battery packs;\n- A lack of knowledge and information on the proprietary electronics of battery cells; and\n- Fluctuations in the percentage of metals within batteries and fluctuations in the price of recycled metals.\n\n6.2.2 Possible solutions and applications\n\nCollecting and grouping EV batteries by model can minimise the effort involved in identifying batteries that have different chemical compounds.

The market in North America for EVs has surged over the last 10 years and the supply of end-of-life batteries is expected to continue to increase.\n\nA few key companies in North America have the technology and capacity to process NiMH and Li-ion batteries from EVs. These include Retrive, Inmetco, Glencore/Xstrata and RMC.\n\nA new UL standard, UL 1974 deals with second life applications for batteries. It has been proposed that this standard be developed into an American National Standard, which will help address safety and performance testing issues for intended applications, as well as help create guidelines for removing grid connections, communication interfaces or electronic parts from the pack with destroying it.\n\nEurope\n\nWhen it comes to legislation pertaining to battery recycling, Europe is the undisputed leader. The European Batteries Directive, first adopted in 1991, sets clear targets on collection and recycling rates for all types of batteries. Umicore conducts a number of recycling activities in Europe. The French metal recycling company, SNAM (Societe Nouvelle d\u2019 Affinage des Metauz), processes up to 300 tonnes of Li-ion batteries annually. Euro Dieuze Industrie, another French company, specializes in battery recycling, including the recovery of lithium. In France, Recupyl treats spent batteries from HEVs, PHEVs, and EVs by using hydrometallurgy techniques.\n\nAlso in Europe, solar retail grid parity has been achieved. Recycling companies re-package retired batteries and use them in residential photovoltaic (PV) systems. Retired batteries store energy generated from solar panels, with consumers benefitting by paying less money to electric companies for power drawn from the electricity grid. Besides being integrated with solar systems, retired batteries can also be re-packaged and used with windmills to store electricity generated by wind power.\n\nJapan\n\nNissan Motor Co. has partnered with Sumitomo Corporation to initiate a business plan to recover and resell used EV batteries.", "start_char_idx": 239804, "end_char_idx": 242155, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d31f27a5-58ef-42ab-8db0-dea5d05c6431": {"__data__": {"id_": "d31f27a5-58ef-42ab-8db0-dea5d05c6431", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ef133e0-c32e-458b-8aae-8d7fbed2579b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "a590dcd150456a2e5d623f2a51a7ecf856f826153eff6330580accc0de435860", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2d6802b0-8e89-45fb-94eb-91f46ddcec6e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "186dcbe6c914113f8a18364da43e74164f32376f41389ddc8afdbfcf959d71a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b7adc864-f2ec-4242-af1e-ec3524cfa9f9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4ac5b207add67b98f183c4f15dda5888699f90838abcb386a73d966a944f330c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "They have established a new joint venture company called 4R ENERGY Corporation to conduct research and field tests on the second life usage of Li-ion batteries that have been previously used in EVs.

According to Environmental Protection Department regulations, retired batteries must be treated as chemical waste. Under the Waste Disposal (Chemical Waste) (General) Regulation, battery recycling companies should register as licensed waste collectors for chemical waste in order to conduct proper disposal, and are required to comply with the requirements of the Regulation on packaging, labelling, storage and trip tickets. At the moment, there are only four licensed chemical waste collectors who are able to handle waste batteries from EVs on EPD\u2019s authorised list.\n\nFurthermore, waste battery collectors only can send retired batteries to other countries for further treatment, like Japan, Korea and Singapore, since the lack of land in Hong Kong prevents the construction or implementation of chemical recycling processes.\n\nIn fact, the policy makers could take a more aggressive role the development of the battery recycling industry and promoting the value of second life batteries in general. In 2016, the \u201cInternational Competition on Second Life for Retired Batteries from Electric Vehicles\u201d was organized. The competition gave the public an opportunity to design and repack retired batteries in different ways that were suitable to the Hong Kong situation, giving people more insight into ways to extend the value of retired batteries and potential methods in which they could be reused.\n\nElectrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) has collaborated with APAS and HKPC to explore possible second life applications of retired EV batteries through proof-of-concept projects.

This report reviewed the EV adoption status in major cities around the world and the government policies of several major countries regarding promoting the adoption of EVs. Specific needs in Hong Kong were identified to help the city work towards the idea of green transportation through the use of EVs as both private cars and commercial vehicles. Compared with private electric vehicles, commercial EV adoption in Hong Kong still faces great challenges and more effort is required to promote EVs for commercial use.

Commercial vehicles are the major source of roadside emissions in Hong Kong. Efforts to reduce these emissions will be much more effective if commercial vehicles were powered by electricity instead of internal combustion engines. This report's recommendations for promoting commercial EVs include:\n\n- Installing quick charging facilities with a minimum of 200kW which can charge a typical commercial EV battery within 30 minutes;\n- High-power charging stations should be located near highway entrances and exits. Charging stations should be built to ensure that heavy-duty commercial EVs can complete their entire journey on a highway, thus located these charging stations near highway entrances and exits is necessary;\n- Develop EVs for commercial use, as there are currently no approved models for medium-duty vehicles, heavy-duty vehicles or special-purpose vehicles like crane lorries, tankers, dump trucks, tractors, or refuse collection vehicles.\n\nThe development of EV charging in Hong Kong. Over the past few years, stakeholders in the EV charging industry have been more proactive about contributing to the expansion of the EV charging network to support the rapid growth of EV adoption in Hong Kong. However, there are still many challenges involved in catering to the possible future demands that will be placed on Hong Kong's EV charging infrastructure:\n\n1. Business model concerns \u2013 There is little incentive for the development of sustainable charging service businesses (which offer paid charging services), since the majority of public charging services are currently offered for free. Therefore, incorporated owners are still hesitant to invest in or approve the installation of EV chargers.\n2. Lack of a centralised data platform \u2013 A centralised data platform is critical to the sharing of EV charging data such as the real-time status of chargers. Such a platform will allow the various stakeholders to tailor their products and services to EV users more effectively, and for EV users to enjoy a more convenient charging experience. In addition, establishing a neutral industry association comprised of members from the various stakeholders.\n---\n## CHAPTER 7\n\nStakeholders will help to drive the development of the industry and share a variety of engineering points of view with the Government.\n\nEmerging charging technologies \u2013 Innovative EV charging technologies and solutions are emerging, and governments around the world are keen to adopt these technologies to benefit the public.", "start_char_idx": 249209, "end_char_idx": 251857, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5bf90f74-7a2b-4605-8e7e-07e94d19184d": {"__data__": {"id_": "5bf90f74-7a2b-4605-8e7e-07e94d19184d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ef133e0-c32e-458b-8aae-8d7fbed2579b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "a590dcd150456a2e5d623f2a51a7ecf856f826153eff6330580accc0de435860", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "642d54a8-8226-46ca-98be-cfab16391b60", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/abiorh/ai/rag/new/APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_name": "APASEVstudy__online_ver.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5265058, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-21"}, "hash": "43438a5c3421de1b8ad94e11b3b3cc168c1fc907e21b02747269e72f1ebc65e1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6237eccd-ed98-48c0-b185-a1ab77e087ba", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c5d94a3d11f15ae2e6d8455b779f80e02889847dc862df21e48b3ee8ee7646fa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In federal action announced by the US government, the government is creating an environment which will facilitate big data analytics to inspire new EV charging solutions.
